#### Stochastic Block Model Methods for Bipartite Graphs

Many of the phenomena in nature and society can be represented as networks. Networks can be complicated and to understand them, it is a good idea to reduce them into structural blocks. One of the techniques to deduce structural blocks is Stochastic Block Modelling (SBM). As many of the systems, say, drug target, predator-prey, plant-pollinators can be represented in bipartite networks, we consider deducing structures in bipartite networks.
In this project, we have implemented a standard stochastic block model and a degree-corrected stochastic block model using brute force search algorithm and a heuristic algorithm similar to Kernighan-Lin algorithm. Minimum description length principle is implemented to automate the number of communities
to be detected in a network.
We have verified our implementation on three networks and experimented the degree-corrected stochastic block model on seven real world networks.
